# **Sales Forecasting Using ARIMA**
In this project, we are going to predict the future monthly sales of Perrin Freres Champagne.
### **Dataset: Perrin Freres Monthly Champagne Sales**
The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/galibce003/perrin-freres-monthly-champagne-sales) is collected from Kaggle, which is posted by [MD. Mehedi Hassan Galib](https://www.kaggle.com/galibce003). It has 2 columns and 107 rows, from which 2 rows contains unimportant data. We'll clean our dataset, later.

We used SARIMAX to train the model on our trainset and predict on the test set. The figure below shows the comparison between the predicted sales vs. the actual sales from the testset.
